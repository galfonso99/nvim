What is Kickstart?

  Kickstart.nvim is *not* a distribution.

  Kickstart.nvim is a starting point for your own configuration.
    The goal is that you can read every line of code, top-to-bottom, understand
    what your configuration is doing, and modify it to suit your needs.

    Once you've done that, you can start exploring, configuring and tinkering to
    make Neovim your own! That might mean leaving Kickstart just the way it is for a while
    or immediately breaking it into modular pieces. It's up to you!

    If you don't know anything about Lua, I recommend taking some time to read through
    a guide. One possible example which will only take 10-15 minutes:
      - https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/lua/

    After understanding a bit more about Lua, you can use `:help lua-guide` as a
    reference for how Neovim integrates Lua.
    - :help lua-guide
    - (or HTML version): https://neovim.io/doc/user/lua-guide.html

Kickstart Guide:

  TODO: The very first thing you should do is to run the command `:Tutor` in Neovim.

    If you don't know what this means, type the following:
      - <escape key>
      - :
      - Tutor
      - <enter key>

    (If you already know the Neovim basics, you can skip this step.)

  Once you've completed that, you can continue working through **AND READING** the rest
  of the kickstart init.lua.

  Next, run AND READ `:help`.
    This will open up a help window with some basic information
    about reading, navigating and searching the builtin help documentation.

    This should be the first place you go to look when you're stuck or confused
    with something. It's one of my favorite Neovim features.

    MOST IMPORTANTLY, we provide a keymap "<space>sh" to [s]earch the [h]elp documentation,
    which is very useful when you're not exactly sure of what you're looking for.

  I have left several `:help X` comments throughout the init.lua
    These are hints about where to find more information about the relevant settings,
    plugins or Neovim features used in Kickstart.

   NOTE: Look for lines like this

    Throughout the file. These are for you, the reader, to help you understand what is happening.
    Feel free to delete them once you know what you're doing, but they should serve as a guide
    for when you are first encountering a few different constructs in your Neovim config.

If you experience any errors while trying to install kickstart, run `:checkhealth` for more info.

-- [[ Basic Autocommands ]]
--  See `:help lua-guide-autocommands`

-- Highlight when yanking (copying) text
--  Try it with `yap` in normal mode
--  See `:help vim.highlight.on_yank()`

-- [[ Configure and install plugins ]]
--
--  To check the current status of your plugins, run
--    :Lazy
--
--  You can press `?` in this menu for help. Use `:q` to close the window
--
--  To update plugins you can run
--    :Lazy update
--
-- NOTE: Plugins can also be added by using a table,
-- with the first argument being the link and the following
-- keys can be used to configure plugin behavior/loading/etc.
--
-- Use `opts = {}` to force a plugin to be loaded.
--

-- Here is a more advanced example where we pass configuration
-- options to `gitsigns.nvim`. This is equivalent to the following Lua:
--    require('gitsigns').setup({ ... })
--
-- See `:help gitsigns` to understand what the configuration keys do
--
-- NOTE: Plugins can also be configured to run Lua code when they are loaded.
--
-- This is often very useful to both group configuration, as well as handle
-- lazy loading plugins that don't need to be loaded immediately at startup.
--
-- For example, in the following configuration, we use:
--  event = 'VimEnter'
--
-- which loads which-key before all the UI elements are loaded. Events can be
-- normal autocommands events (`:help autocmd-events`).
--
-- Then, because we use the `config` key, the configuration only runs
-- after the plugin has been loaded:
--  config = function() ... end

-- NOTE: Plugins can specify dependencies.
--
-- The dependencies are proper plugin specifications as well - anything
-- you do for a plugin at the top level, you can do for a dependency.
--
-- Use the `dependencies` key to specify the dependencies of a particular plugin


-- Telescope is a fuzzy finder that comes with a lot of different things that
-- it can fuzzy find! It's more than just a "file finder", it can search
-- many different aspects of Neovim, your workspace, LSP, and more!
--
-- The easiest way to use Telescope, is to start by doing something like:
--  :Telescope help_tags
--
-- After running this command, a window will open up and you're able to
-- type in the prompt window. You'll see a list of `help_tags` options and
-- a corresponding preview of the help.
--
-- Two important keymaps to use while in Telescope are:
--  - Insert mode: <c-/>
--  - Normal mode: ?
--
-- This opens a window that shows you all of the keymaps for the current
-- Telescope picker. This is really useful to discover what Telescope can
-- do as well as how to actually do it!

-- [[ Configure Telescope ]]
-- See `:help telescope` and `:help telescope.setup()`

-- You can put your default mappings / updates / etc. in here
--  All the info you're looking for is in `:help telescope.setup()`
--
-- defaults = {
--   mappings = {
--     i = { ['<c-enter>'] = 'to_fuzzy_refine' },
--   },
-- },
--
-- Brief aside: **What is LSP?**
--
-- LSP is an initialism you've probably heard, but might not understand what it is.
--
-- LSP stands for Language Server Protocol. It's a protocol that helps editors
-- and language tooling communicate in a standardized fashion.
--
-- In general, you have a "server" which is some tool built to understand a particular
-- language (such as `gopls`, `lua_ls`, `rust_analyzer`, etc.). These Language Servers
-- (sometimes called LSP servers, but that's kind of like ATM Machine) are standalone
-- processes that communicate with some "client" - in this case, Neovim!
--
-- LSP provides Neovim with features like:
--  - Go to definition
--  - Find references
--  - Autocompletion
--  - Symbol Search
--  - and more!
--
-- Thus, Language Servers are external tools that must be installed separately from
-- Neovim. This is where `mason` and related plugins come into play.
--
-- If you're wondering about lsp vs treesitter, you can check out the wonderfully

-- and elegantly composed help section, `:help lsp-vs-treesitter`
--
--
--
-- NOTE: Remember that Lua is a real programming language, and as such it is possible
-- to define small helper and utility functions so you don't have to repeat yourself.
--
-- In this case, we create a function that lets us more easily define mappings specific
-- for LSP related items. It sets the mode, buffer and description for us each time.
--
      -- LSP servers and clients are able to communicate to each other what features they support.
      --  By default, Neovim doesn't support everything that is in the LSP specification.
      --  When you add nvim-cmp, luasnip, etc. Neovim now has *more* capabilities.
      --  So, we create new capabilities with nvim cmp, and then broadcast that to the servers.
--
--
--      -- Enable the following language servers
      --  Feel free to add/remove any LSPs that you want here. They will automatically be installed.
      --
      --  Add any additional override configuration in the following tables. Available keys are:
      --  - cmd (table): Override the default command used to start the server
      --  - filetypes (table): Override the default list of associated filetypes for the server
      --  - capabilities (table): Override fields in capabilities. Can be used to disable certain LSP features.
      --  - settings (table): Override the default settings passed when initializing the server.
      --        For example, to see the options for `lua_ls`, you could go to: https://luals.github.io/wiki/settings/

     -- local servers = {


        --
        -- Some languages (like typescript) have entire language plugins that can be useful:
        --    https://github.com/pmizio/typescript-tools.nvim
        --
        -- But for many setups, the LSP (`ts_ls`) will work just fine
        -- ts_ls = {},
        --
